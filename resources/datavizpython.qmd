# Introduction

This material gives an introduction to Data Visualization in Python for Beginners.

For more details you can consult the following reference materials:

1. [Data Visualization with Python for Beginners. *Visualize Your Data Using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn*](https://www.google.co.ke/books/edition/Data_Visualization_with_Python_for_Begin/RdRizQEACAAJ?hl=en)


2. [Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript. *Scrape, Clean, Explore and Transform Your Data*](https://www.google.co.ke/books/edition/Data_Visualization_with_Python_and_JavaS/PCCTDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

### Important

Codes are given in this tutorial. You can copy and paste them on your pc. 
:::

Install Anaconda on your Laptop. [For details on how to install anaconda see here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/)


# Data Science and Data Visualization

:::{.callout-tip}
### Data Science
This is the science of extracting and exploring data in order to find patterns that can be used to make decisions in organizations.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
### Data Visualization
This is a subdomain of data science where you visualize data with the help of graphs and tables in order to identify important patterns.
:::

Visualizing data graphically can reveal trends that otherwise may be hidden from the naked eye of a person.

Data visualization is a step to important processes such as:

 * Data Science
 * Machine Learning
 * Business Intelligence
 * Data Analytics

**Data Visualization is one of the important skill sets of this century if you want to secure a data science job**

Please you can watch this video on *A Data Scientists Perspective of the importance of data visualization to data science*

# Writing Your First Program

In order to write a program in Anaconda, you have to launch Anaconda Navigator. 

Search *Anaconda Navigator* in your Windows Search Box. Once you click on the application the Anaconda's dashboard will open. 

We will use the *Jupyter Notebook* in this resource.

![](/files/anaconda.png)

The top right corner of Jupyter Notebookâ€™s own dashboard houses a New button, you have to click to open a new document. From the dropdown that has several options click on Python 3.

A new Jupyter Notebook will appear that looks like this

The Jupyter Notebook consists of cells that makes its **layout very simple and straightforward**.

We can write our first program as:

```python
print("Welcome to Data Visualization with Python")
```

### Important Requirements: Anaconda, Jupyter, Matplotlib

- All the scripts in this tutorial are written in Jupyter Notebook

- We will explore the following visualization modules:

  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Pandas
  * Plotly
:::

To install a python library use the following in a Jupyter Notebook cell

```python
# install pandas library

!pip install pandas
```

To load any Python library use

```python

# loading library

import pandas as pd
```


# Python Variables and Data Types

In a programming language **data types** refers to the type of data that the language is capable of processing.

In Python the major data types supported include:

- Strings
- Integers
- Floating Point Numbers
- Booleans
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries

# Data Visualization Libraries

:::{.callout-tip}
### Matplotlib
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is the default static data visualization in Python. 

Many wrappers libraries like Pandas and Seaborn have been developed on top of Matplolib

:::


:::{.callout-tip}
### Seaborn
This library is built on top of the Matplotlib library and contains all the plotting capabilities of Matplotlib.

:::


:::{.callout-tip}
### Basemap
This is an extension of the Matplotlib and is used for plotting Geographical Maps in Python
:::


:::{.callout-tip}
### Pandas
Pandas library, like Seaborn, is based on the Matplotlib library and offers utilities that can be used to plot different types of static plots in a single line of codes.
:::


:::{.callout-tip}
### Plotly
Plotly is an online data visualization platform that supports interactive data visualization. More will be explored.
:::


:::{.callout-important}
### Importance of Data Visualization
- A good visualization:

  * Communicates a piece of complex information in a simple, clear and concise manner to top business leaders
  * Enables users focus on actionable insights
  * Provides insights and story to establish business goals by giving attention to unnoticed patterns
  * Helps businesses make real-time decisions
