Visualize Your Data Using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn\nData Visualization with Python and JavaScript. Scrape, Clean, Explore and Transform Your Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nCodes are given in this tutorial. You can copy and paste them on your pc.\n\n\nInstall Anaconda on your Laptop. For details on how to install anaconda see here\n\n\nData Science and Data Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science\n\n\n\nThis is the science of extracting and exploring data in order to find patterns that can be used to make decisions in organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization\n\n\n\nThis is a subdomain of data science where you visualize data with the help of graphs and tables in order to identify important patterns.\n\n\nVisualizing data graphically can reveal trends that otherwise may be hidden from the naked eye of a person.\nData visualization is a step to important processes such as:\n\nData Science\nMachine Learning\nBusiness Intelligence\nData Analytics\n\nData Visualization is one of the important skill sets of this century if you want to secure a data science job\nPlease you can watch this video on A Data Scientists Perspective of the importance of data visualization to data science\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting Your First Program\nIn order to write a program in Anaconda, you have to launch Anaconda Navigator.\nSearch Anaconda Navigator in your Windows Search Box. Once you click on the application the Anaconda’s dashboard will open.\nWe will use the Jupyter Notebook in this resource.\n\nThe top right corner of Jupyter Notebook’s own dashboard houses a New button, you have to click to open a new document. From the dropdown that has several options click on Python 3.\n\nA new Jupyter Notebook will appear that looks like this\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook consists of cells that makes its layout very simple and straightforward.\nWe can write our first program as:\nprint(\"Welcome to Data Visualization with Python\")\n\nImportant Requirements: Anaconda, Jupyter, Matplotlib\n\nAll the scripts in this tutorial are written in Jupyter Notebook\nWe will explore the following visualization modules:\n\nMatplotlib\nSeaborn\nPandas\nPlotly\n\n\n\nTo install a python library use the following in a Jupyter Notebook cell\n# install pandas library\n\n!pip install pandas\nTo load any Python library use\n\n# loading library\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\nPython Variables and Data Types\nIn a programming language data types refers to the type of data that the language is capable of processing.\nIn Python the major data types supported include:\n\nStrings\nIntegers\nFloating Point Numbers\nBooleans\nLists\nTuples\nDictionaries\n\nFor more details see Crash Course in Python\n\n\nData Visualization Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatplotlib\n\n\n\nMatplotlib is the default static data visualization in Python.\nMany wrappers libraries like Pandas and Seaborn have been developed on top of Matplolib\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeaborn\n\n\n\nThis library is built on top of the Matplotlib library and contains all the plotting capabilities of Matplotlib.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasemap\n\n\n\nThis is an extension of the Matplotlib and is used for plotting Geographical Maps in Python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPandas\n\n\n\nPandas library, like Seaborn, is based on the Matplotlib library and offers utilities that can be used to plot different types of static plots in a single line of codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly\n\n\n\nPlotly is an online data visualization platform that supports interactive data visualization.
